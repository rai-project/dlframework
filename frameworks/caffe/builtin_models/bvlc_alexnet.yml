description: >
  The bundled model is the iteration 360,000 snapshot. The best validation
  performance during training was iteration 358,000 with validation accuracy
  57.258% and loss 1.83948. This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.1% and a
  top-5 accuracy 80.2% on the validation set, using just the center crop.
  (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain
  a bit higher accuracy.)
